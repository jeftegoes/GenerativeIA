# 1. Definition

- Computer Vision is a field of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that enables computers to **interpret, analyze, and understand visual data** such as images and videos.
- Although it has existed since the **1950s** (e.g., barcode scanners), major breakthroughs in the last decade—driven by better algorithms, data, and computing power—have made it widely usable.
- Today, computer vision is embedded in daily life:
  - Face detection in smartphone cameras
  - Automatic photo tagging on social media
  - Autonomous vehicles

# 2. Why Computer Vision Matters for Business

- Humans process **~90% of information visually**, which historically required human labor.
- Computer vision allows many vision-based tasks to be **automated**, including:
  - Inspections
  - Monitoring
  - Quality control
  - Medical image analysis
- Benefits include:
  - Higher speed and accuracy
  - Cost reduction
  - Increased efficiency
  - Freeing humans for more creative and meaningful work
- It is one of the **easiest AI technologies to implement** in business contexts.

# 3. How Computer Vision Works - Big Picture

## 3.1. Common Myth

- False: Computer vision works only with deep learning.
- Reality: There are **two main approaches**

## 3.2. Key Takeaways on Computer Vision Algorithms

- There are **two types**: classical and deep learning.
- Classical methods:
  - Fast, efficient, and accurate for common objects.
- Deep learning:
  - More powerful for complex or specialized tasks.
- The best solutions often combine **both approaches**.

## 3.3. Classical Computer Vision

- Uses **pre-built feature libraries** to detect known patterns.
- Example:
  - Face detection by identifying eyes, nose, and mouth.
- Characteristics:
  - No neural networks
  - Very fast and efficient
  - Works best for common, well-defined objects
- Ideal for:
  - Real-time detection
  - Simple, repeatable tasks

## 3.4. Deep Learning Computer Vision

- Uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.
- Learns features automatically from data.
- Process:
  - Trained on large volumes of **labeled images**
  - Learns distinguishing features on its own
- Advantages:
  - Handles complex and custom tasks
  - Adapts to new patterns and environments
- Best used when:
  - Classical methods are insufficient
  - The task requires deeper understanding

# 4. Example: Tomato Sorting with Computer Vision

## 4.1. Traditional Approach

- Humans manually inspect tomatoes on a conveyor belt.
- Drawbacks:
  - Labor costs
  - Human error
  - Slower processing
  - Sick days and absences
  - Low job satisfaction

## 4.2. Computer Vision Approach

- Train a deep learning model using:
  - Images of good tomatoes
  - Images of unripe or rotten tomatoes
- Data collection:
  - Use cameras to observe human decisions
  - Automatically label training data
- After training:
  - The system autonomously identifies and removes bad tomatoes
  - A simple robotic mechanism handles sorting

## 4.3. Benefits

- Lower costs
- Higher accuracy
- Faster processing
- No downtime
- Humans focus on more meaningful work

# 5. Core Applications of Computer Vision

1. **Image Classification**
   - Categorizes images (e.g., defective vs. working parts).
2. **Image Segmentation**
   - Divides images into regions (e.g., background blur in video calls).
3. **Object Detection**
   - Identifies and locates objects in images.
   - In some tasks, AI exceeds human accuracy.
4. **Object Tracking**
   - Tracks movement over time (e.g., pedestrian tracking, collision prevention).
5. **Image Generation**
   - Style transfer, 3D reconstruction from 2D images.
6. **Edge Detection**
   - Identifies object boundaries.
7. **Face Detection**
   - Locates faces in images.
8. **Facial Recognition**
   - Identifies specific individuals.
9. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**
   - Reads text from printed or handwritten documents.
   - Accuracy >99% in many cases.
10. **Pattern Detection**
    - Finds recurring shapes, colors, or structures.
11. **Feature Matching**
    - Matches similarities across images.
