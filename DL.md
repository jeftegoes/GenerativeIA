# 1. Definition

- Deep Learning is a **subset of Machine Learning**, which itself is a subset of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.
- It is based on **artificial neural networks** with multiple layers (deep neural networks).
- These networks are inspired by how the **human brain processes information**, though they are far from human-level general intelligence.
- **Hierarchy**

## 1.1. What Makes Deep Learning Different?

- **No predefined framework or rules**
  - Traditional ML relies on manually designed features and models.
  - Deep learning **learns features automatically** from raw data.
- **Learns from experience**
  - Similar to how humans learn by observing and interacting with the world.
- **Highly flexible**
  - Can be applied to images, text, audio, video, and structured data.

# 2. How Deep Neural Networks Work (Intuition)

- Neural networks consist of:
  - **Input layer**
  - **Hidden layers** (one or many)
  - **Output layer**
- Each neuron has **weights** that determine how information flows.
- Learning happens by:
  - Comparing predictions with correct answers.
  - Adjusting weights using a process called **backpropagation**.
- Training is:
  - Iterative.
  - Data-intensive.
  - Gradual improvement over time.

## 2.1. Example: Dog vs. Cat Classification

- Feed the network thousands of labeled images.
- The model:
  - Automatically learns features (ears, size, whiskers, shapes).
  - Requires no manual feature engineering.
- After training:
  - Accurately classifies unseen images

# 3. Strengths and Limitations of Deep Learning

## 3.1. Advantages

- Extremely high accuracy in complex tasks
- Excels at:
  - Image recognition.
  - Speech recognition.
  - Handwritten text recognition (≈99% accuracy).
- Scales well with large datasets.

## 3.2. Drawbacks

- Requires **large volumes of data**.
- Computationally expensive.
- Less interpretable ("black box" behavior).

# 4. Why Experts Are Still Needed

- Neural networks can learn automatically, but:
  - **Architecture design** is critical.
  - Number of layers, neurons, and structure matter.
- Designing architectures is:
  - Creative.
  - Problem-specific.
- This explains why data scientists and ML engineers are:
  - Highly specialized.
  - In high demand.

# 5. Deep Learning + Other AI Technologies

- Deep learning can enhance other AI fields:
  - **Computer Vision -> Deep Computer Vision**
  - **Natural Language Processing -> Deep NLP**
  - **Reinforcement Learning -> Deep Reinforcement Learning**
- Benefits:
  - Higher accuracy.
  - Better generalization.
- Trade-off:
  - Higher computational cost.
- Not always necessary, but often powerful when feasible.
