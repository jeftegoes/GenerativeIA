# 1. Machine Learning

## 1.1. Definition

- Machine Learning is a **discipline within Artificial Intelligence** that teaches computers to:
  - Learn from data
  - Identify patterns
  - Make predictions or decisions
- It relies on **experience (historical data)** to generate insights and **new data** to make predictions.

## 1.2. Machine Learning Within AI

- Hierarchy of concepts:
  - **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** -> broad field
    - **Machine Learning (ML)** -> learning from data
      - **Deep Learning (DL)** -> neural networks with many layers
- These terms are often confused, but ML is a **subset of AI**, and deep learning is a **subset of ML**.

## 1.3. Why ML Is Booming Now

- Machine learning has existed for decades.
- Recent growth is driven by:
  - Faster computers
  - Cheaper storage
  - Massive data availability
- Today, organizations can process huge datasets and extract value at scale.

## 1.4. Why Businesses Use Machine Learning

- According to Peter Drucker, businesses focus on:
  - **Innovation**
  - **Marketing**
  - **Cost reduction**
- Machine learning supports all three:
  - **Innovation**
    - Example: Google’s spam detection improves email experience automatically.
  - **Marketing**
    - Example: Amazon’s recommendation engine increases revenue by **~25%**.
  - **Cost Reduction**
    - Example: JPMorgan replaced **360,000 hours of legal work per year** with a single ML system.

# 2. Core Types of Machine Learning Algorithms

## 2.1. Regression

- Used to predict **continuous numeric values**.
- Examples:
  - Revenue
  - Expenses
  - Mileage
  - Weight
- Types:
  - Simple Linear Regression (one input variable)
  - Multiple Linear Regression (many input variables)
  - Polynomial Regression (non-linear relationships)
- Business example:
  - Predicting revenue based on customer satisfaction, competitors, or weather.

## 2.2. Classification

- Assigns data into **predefined categories**.
- Requires **labeled historical data** (supervised learning).
- Example:
  - Predicting whether a customer will churn or not.
- Scales well to high-dimensional data where human visualization is impossible.
- Used in:
  - Fraud detection
  - Customer retention
  - Credit risk analysis

## 2.3. Clustering

- Groups data based on **natural similarities**.
- No predefined labels (unsupervised learning).
- Used to discover **hidden patterns**.
- Example:
  - Identifying different usage patterns in mining trucks.
- Insights are interpreted **after** clusters are formed.

## 2.4. Association Rule Learning

- Finds relationships between items or events.
- Answers questions like:
  - "If someone buys X, what else are they likely to buy?"
- Famous example:
  - Diapers and beer
- Widely used by:
  - Amazon
  - Netflix
  - Walmart
- Drives:
  - Cross-selling
  - Personalized recommendations
  - Customer experience optimization

# 3. Real-World Machine Learning Use Cases

## 3.1. Regression

- **Bellwether**
  - Predicts floods, wildfires, and storms in minutes instead of hours.
  - Used by insurance companies for damage assessment.
- **Boston Scientific**
  - Identifies failure risks in medical product batches.wwww
  - Revenue doubled from 2016 to 2024.

## 3.2. Classification

- **American Express**
  - Detects credit card fraud.
  - Maintains the lowest fraud rate among major networks.
- **Financial Research Firm**
  - Predicts company credit risk using decision trees.
  - Achieved over **64% accuracy**.

## 3.3. Clustering

- **Spotify**
  - Uses clustering and filtering to personalize music recommendations.
  - Surpassed **260 million users** in 2024.
- **Wells Fargo**
  - Improved portfolio return explainability from **74% to 85%**.
  - Automated hours of analyst work.

## 3.4. Association Rule Learning

- **Tourism in Bali**
  - Identified attraction combinations and seasonal trends.
  - Supported post-pandemic recovery:
    - 6.3 million visitors in 2024
    - 54% of population employed by tourism
- **Amazon**
  - Product recommendations drive:
    - **44% of purchases**
    - **28% higher brand loyalty** among millennials

# 4. Key Takeaways

- Machine learning enables businesses to:
  - Predict outcomes
  - Discover patterns
  - Automate decisions
- Core algorithm families:
  - Regression
  - Classification
  - Clustering
  - Association rule learning
- Competitive pressure will push organizations to adopt ML.
